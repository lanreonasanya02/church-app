      "Many are in search of a divine encounter with God but what is a Divine encounter? An encounter means meeting with something, most likely in an unexpected way through an event or incident. A divine encounter with God is man meeting with God which is a supernatural encounter because God is Spirit and divine. There was a time before the (first) coming of Jesus where it was scarce for anyone to just encounter God because the earth was filled with ungodly men who had rejected God in their hearts. In the old days, God did not freely reveal Himself to all men (as He has now done) because the heart of man did not search for God but if there is a man who is willing, whose heart truly searches for God, God reveals Himself to that man which is called “divine encounter”. God reveals Himself to the end that man may know Him, believe Him, and be saved - Genesis 6:3, Exodus 3:2-4, Acts 9:3-6. God has now freely made Himself available again and all men have access to God through “divine encounters” (even daily). Your dreams, visions, prophesies, and hearing from God, are all divine encounters with God but the lack of faith makes some turn a blind eye to the revelation of God which they have seen and do not consider God after all these things but continue to search for something other than what they’ve seen - Matthew 13:16-17. An encounter could be physical or spiritual, depending on How the LORD determines to reveal Himself to man but in either case, God reveals Himself in a way that man will know Him, hear His voice, and be able to identify His will, however, the whole matter depends on the faith of the individual who encounters God, and how he receives the revelation of God in himself - Luke 1:11-20, 26-45.The Pharisees thought that the messiah should come from a great house and would not accept the Jesus that God did reveal to them so they set their hearts against God’s Holy Son, and sought a different messiah than the one God sent. Many today are in search of the superficial though God has already revealed Himself in many encounters yet they have continued to reject God because they would not believe what their eyes have seen, and what their ears have heard - Matthew 11:11-19.",

      "All forms of lying are of the devil so anyone who continues to lie does not possess the Spirit of truth but a deceptive spirit. Lying is not a part of God nor was any lie found on the lips of Jesus and lying is not part of the fruit of the Holy Spirit - 1 Peter 2:22. In the case of the prostitute Rahab, who lied (when she was defending the Israelite scouts being at that time a person who had not yet known the ways of the LORD), she did what she thought best in her understanding. Her lie was not what protected the Israelite scouts but God, and neither did God use her lie to His advantage but He overlooked her sin seeing in her a sincere desire (faith) not to perish with the ungodly - Joshua 2:1-11. A Christian will never need to tell a lie if he lives daily according to the Spirit’s leadership and counsel. People lie when they take matters into their own hands and pursue selfish ambitions in the world. They lie to be accepted by there, to steal, to cheat, to kill. Above all, lying produces destruction and never the righteousness of God - Galatians 5:16. God is divine and His Spirit is the Spirit of Truth. If a Christian cannot speak or find the right words he is better off remaining silent because everyone will be accounted for every idle word which they speak - Matthew 12:36. Anyone who lies has an evil heart and hates the truth and will not be able to serve God because he is insincere with himself and with others - Proverbs 17:4. Christians ought not to lie because we are called to speak the truth (of God) and prove it by living righteously according to every word of God so whether we speak or act our lives must point to the truth (who is God) so that those who hear us and are willing to believe us can be saved - 1 Peter 2:11-12",

      "Discernment is a spiritual gift that is added to a believer as he grows in the love of God. The love of God produces empathy for His church enabling believers to love one another more effectively and one of the gifts that allows a believer to care for the household of God is discernment. Discernment is a gift of love, which allows a believer to be mindful of his brethren in Christ and care for them appropriately. It is a gift usually present in the life of shepherds of the church of God so that they can rightly monitor and care for the flock of God and keep them alert and free from the dangers and troubles that oppose their faith - Philippians 2:5-7.Discernment is not suspicion because suspicion has to do with experience which sometimes produces false imaginations but discernment is divine and produces accurate results every time. Discernment has to do with love while suspicion has to do with fear. Discernment is selfless while suspicion is selfish. A suspicious mind is untrusting whereas a discerning heart is always hopeful - Proverbs 17:24. A suspicious person sows discord among brethren and find faults in others to protect and justify his wicked imaginations but a discerning person is wise and does not work iniquity. Suspicion may sometimes be correct but it leaves torment in the mind of the suspicious person because he is unsure of his suspicion but the discerning heart has peace and assurance because his counsel comes from the LORD, who knows all men - Proverbs 6:12-14.Discernment is given to man to identify the spirit that is in man whether it is of God or not and to discern the will of God so that we may identify the intentions of God and carry out His will - 1 Corinthians 2:11-12, 15-16. Christ operated fully in the mind of God to discern the will of God that he may accurately carry out God’s will for his life on earth toward His church because he is the Son of God and we are like Christ if we also possess the same mind as Christ, doing the same things that he did.",

      "There is a heaviness that falls on a person which denies him the benefits that he should receive and be blessed by in the LORD. It can come upon the eyes, legs, hands, and heart of a man. The heaviness of the eyes makes one sleepy that he cannot pray - Matthew 26:43. The heaviness of the legs makes one weak in prayer that he cannot stand in prayer to pray, that is; to lack the strength to pray in a spiritually upright manner - Hebrews 12:12-13. The heaviness of the hands makes a man idle and unable to work diligently toward the divine purpose given to each one according to the will of God - Proverbs 10:4, Nehemiah 8:6. The heaviness of the heart is a loss of faith when a man becomes tired in spirit and becomes unwilling to continue to wait on God because hope in God has become a burden too great to bear - Psalm 69:20, Proverbs 12:25. The spirit of heaviness is not from God but from the world which makes one tired of godliness and the spiritual life of Christ which can enrich and enlighten the soul. The Spirit of God alone gives lightness to a believer’s heart who has trusted in His word and continues to do so -  Isaiah 61:1-3. Heaviness can be an attack of the devil against a believer who still secretly longs for the world and he is attacked when he does not expect it because of the idols of his heart - Matthew 13:25. Heaviness can also be a man’s choice because his heart departs from the LORD when he is enticed by the things of the world he suddenly becomes heavy by everything that concerns God but spends hours enjoying himself in what his heart truly desires - Luke 21:34, 1 Samuel 16:14.Every believer should desire and pursue to be in the presence of the LORD always (in spirit and truth) where there is lightness (peace) for their soul from all troubles - Psalm 27:4, Psalm 16:11",

      "Christians possess a priceless treasure—eternal life—which is worth more than all the riches of this world. Because of this, they become targets of various enemies, some of which are unseen. Unseen enemies are the most dangerous because they strike without warning. For Christians, these enemies exist in different forms, yet many remain unaware of them. It is crucial for a believer to have knowledge and discernment to identify these threats. A lack of understanding about unseen enemies has caused many Christians to compromise their faith and struggle to do God's will (Psalm 22:12-13). However, awareness of unseen enemies should not lead to fear or paranoia. God is on our side, and He knows all things. A Christian must simply remain devoted to God and walk in obedience to His Word. Those who stay in God's presence daily are already on the path to overcoming every tactic and attack of unseen enemies.

      "A man's daily needs go beyond food and clothing, all of which are summed up in money. Yet, the unbeliever thinks that money is all he needs to survive. However, each day brings challenges that require much more than food, clothes, or what money can afford. Many people suffer from troubles they cannot identify or understand because they lack the resources to deal with their problems properly. Still, they continue to seek money for food and clothes, surviving each day on a whim — which, at the end of the day, is not their strength but God's mercy. Some have great wealth, eat exotic foods, and dress in luxury, yet their lives remain filled with troubles they cannot overcome (Proverbs 25:24, Proverbs 17:1).  Jesus taught His disciples to pursue God earnestly because, in Him, they would find provision for all their daily needs—beyond food and clothing—to overcome the evil each day brings (Matthew 6:7-8). Pursuing God's Kingdom and righteousness means that a Christian desires and seeks God above all else. This should be the posture of every believer's heart, as it is the position that empowers us to overcome life's daily struggles (John 16:33, Psalm 23:1).",

      "This mark we speak of is for identification. It's a sign that identifies us as children of God. It can come as a covenant, revealing our position and destiny in life. The LORD placed a mark on Cain so that anyone who saw him could not even conceive death against him. When God places a mark upon a person, it can elevate them to the highest level, but it can also bring them to their knees. There are marks that alienate people from good things, no matter how closely those things happen around them, while others carry marks that bring favor and honor their way. What kind of mark is upon you? Is it God's mark or the devil's mark? Acts 19:15-17 – When God's mark is upon your life, even the kingdom of darkness recognizes and respects it. Pray to God so that you may discern the kind of mark that is upon you. Exodus 12:7, 12-13 – There are people who are never present on the day of evil. No matter how frequently they visit a place, on the day of evil, the Lord will surely remove them. (Psalm 91:1, 27:5). Leviticus 19:28 – Some people have desecrated their bodies by drawing marks of their desire, thereby erasing the mark of God from their lives. God identifies us by the mark He has placed upon us. If we lose that mark, He will hide His face from us. Some pray incessantly for God's intervention, but when an angel is dispatched with the blessing, he comes and does not find the mark that the recipient should bear. When a person does not bear the mark of God, the mark of the devil is automatically placed upon them. How do you know the person who bears the mark of God? (John 1:29-33) Are you bearing the mark of God upon your life, or are you only wearing that mark when you come to church? Joshua 2:12-21 – That mark is an anointing. Have you removed the anointing of God from your life through disobedience? Have you broken the covenant mark of God upon your life by your actions and inactions? Removing the mark of God makes you susceptible to the attack of the enemy and gives him access. You must pray to God to deliver you today and restore His mark upon your life.",

      "Fear is a common aspect of every human being. There is no human being that has ever lived without experiencing fear. Fear, like every other emotion, is designed to make man completely devoted to God, but the corruption in the heart of man has made him turn his fear toward other things, bowing before them instead of God – Psalm 33:8. What a man fears reveals where his love and desire lie, and the knowledge he possesses drives him to fear, revealing the kind of man he is. It is fear that makes a man who loves his life and trusts in his abilities reject the power of God and create an idol to protect him from his fears – Isaiah 44:15-17. Fear will prove a man as either a believer or an unbeliever in God, depending on whether he chooses to fear God and bow before Him or fear other things and bow before them. Fear motivates self-preservation in man, keeping him in check so that he does not die as a fool who lacks knowledge – Exodus 20:18-21. Many people don't fear God because they don&apos;t know Him. Some do know Him but choose to fear other things because the knowledge of those things is greater in their hearts. Many fear the powers of this world because their message and knowledge are spread everywhere, making it seem as though there is no hope or salvation outside of them – Exodus 5:1-2. Fear can be accidental or intentional. Accidental fear is a temporary fear that arises from an unexpected or overwhelming event beyond comprehension. Intentional fear, however, is the one a person chooses to keep in his heart, allowing it to rule over his life as a means of self-preservation. Accidental fear can become intentional when it is dwelt upon and embraced – Psalm 34:9, Proverbs 10:27. Proper Christian maturity requires an adequate fear of God balanced with the knowledge of His love. This enables us to obey God in a wicked and evil generation that has departed from Him. A believer who lacks the fear of God and knows only His love is imbalanced in serving God, just as one who fears God but lacks knowledge of His love. Mature love for God comes from knowing both His terror and His mercy. Like a child who has never known the terror of his father and inevitably disrespects him, so is a believer who has not been taught the proper knowledge of God. When we understand both His terror and His mercy, we will truly belong to Him and love Him with a holy fear that honors Him – 2 Corinthians 5:11.",

      "One of the common errors of the present-day believer is the desire to gain spiritual approval without the necessary calling and training. Everyone dreams, but not everyone has the gift and understanding to interpret dreams, particularly those that pertain to the lives of others. Some believers unknowingly become obstacles and temptations to the faith of others by wrongfully interpreting dreams. Dreams are a personal revelation to the dreamer about their faith and conviction concerning their life. A dream could be inspired by the Spirit of God or from the devil. Any believer who lacks adequate understanding of the true knowledge of God will easily misinterpret their dreams if they attempt to provide meaning on their own – Genesis 40:1-23. No man has the sole ability to identify the meaning of all mysteries in this world, but there are ways a believer can identify and understand their dreams: 1.⁠⁠ Prayer for God to send understanding concerning a dream (Psalm 119:169). 2.⁠ ⁠Adequate knowledge of the word of God helps a believer determine whether a dream is from God or not, based on scriptural references (Psalm 19:7-8).  3.⁠ ⁠The gift of dream interpretation enables a believer to decipher and interpret dreams in plain words, but this relies on the first two points for the proper training of this gift – Daniel 1:17. As a bonus point, it is also beneficial for a believer to have higher spiritual authority to submit their dreams to for reproof. God will always bear witness to His word, so if a dream is from Him, both the dream and its interpretation will receive testimonies of approval from believers who possess the Spirit of God – 1 Corinthians 14:26-33. Arrogance and fear in this generation have led many unqualified individuals to assume the role of dream interpreters. A dream is better left uninterpreted than given a wrong interpretation that can lead a believer's faith astray – Jeremiah 23:32. Believers should be careful when interpreting dreams for themselves or others. Instead, they should submit to the right authorities in the church so that God's will can be done, and everyone can receive their due blessings and rewards for proper guidance and obedience to His word – Romans 13:1-2.",

      "There was a time when the word of God was scarce and there was no open vision, and such a time will come again. Even now, there are moments in a Christian's life when the word of God may not come to them personally, and there are no visions for them to see. But one thing will remain—the written word of God — and the word of God that they have heard and seen will always stay with them to remind them of what God has said and what He will do. The word of God is like a roadmap for every Christian, and if we keep to it, we will not lose our way. Therefore, Christians must take care to write down the word of God that comes to them personally and also study the Bible, which is the general will of God for all who believe. On the day that the word of God becomes scarce, they can remind themselves of the word they have received—written, heard, and seen—to stay encouraged and steadfast in the way of God – Psalm 32:8, Psalm 119:91-93. Every Christian must grow in the Word so that they can grow in the right content and context. The absence of the word of God in a Christian's life is the reason why they fail to recognize how God speaks, what He can say, and who He is. The Bible contains the history and future of God so that a believer can understand His trajectory and purpose. It is the whole counsel of God – Psalm 119:11. No amount of visions or prophecies in this day and age can outdo the written word of God. It is 'the Word' that has been given by the inspiration of God, to which all prophecies and visions align. Some Christians do not keep a record of God's word by holding it dear to them and writing it down. Instead, they keep it loosely, so when they need the word, they cannot remember it. They begin to panic and fall into temptation, thinking that God has abandoned them. Some seek God for an answer He has already given – Deuteronomy 6:4-9, Isaiah 30:8. It is a matter of urgency and faith that those who have found the truth keep to the instructions and remain standing. Just as it was in the days when the word of God was scarce, so it will be again someday and even momentarily in our lives. But the word of God that you have discovered will remain with you.

      "It is important for a believer to train their hearing in the spirit so that they will be adept at hearing the word of the LORD when He speaks. Many believers are dull in hearing to the point that even when they hear the word physically they cannot discern the voice of the LORD. The hardness of heart is the reason why many cannot hear the voice of God because they are strongly convinced by their thoughts and the imagination of their heart seems right to them so even though they hear God physically, they will not hear him because their hearts reject the word which God speaks but the voice of God comes clearly to those who seek Him in sincere faith; who are bowed down to God in their heart - Exodus 16:15-27, Numbers 12:5-8. Some hear the word of the LORD but doubt the word of God so they hear amiss when He sends His word. They hear doom and are unable to identify God’s mercy and grace which speaks repentance and salvation to all men - Exodus 20:18-21. Some hear faintly in the spirit because they are not attentive and occasionally disobey so the voice of the LORD grows ever faint in their hearts and as an indication of their spiritual distance to God and some have gone deaf completely in spirit not knowing what the LORD’s will is both in spirit and physically because their hearts are hardened - Matthew 13:15. God will not be mocked, He will not continue to send His word to fools so those who increase in hearing God’s voice are those who continue to seek and obey Him whereas those who disobey God and pay no attention to Him will become completely deaf in the spirit not being able to hear nor discern the LORD’s voice but the voice of a stranger they will hear and they will accept as their LORD because the word of God has no place in their hearts - John 8:42-47. Every believer who will follow God till the end of their life must be conscious of training their ears to hear clearly in spirit so that they can know the LORD for themselves and hear from Him so that they will not give heed to another voice that is not of God being deceived that they are with the LORD - John 10:1-6.",

      "The eyes of a person’s spirit must be trained to see promptly and clearly in the spirit to discern the will of God and know where the LORD is taking him and what the LORD has set ahead of him. Visions are a necessity of the spirit, in that; they help a person add context to what the LORD is saying. Often the word of the LORD came to His prophets saying “See”, “Look”, and “Behold” because God wanted his servants to also grasp the picture of what he was saying as clearly as they were hearing Him - Jeremiah 1:11-12. God has handed the gift of visions and dreams to all men so that they can see in the spirit, the LORD, and turn to Him. The eyes of some believers (in spirit) have become so dim that they find it hard to discern the LORD, not being able to tell the difference between a vision, dream, or revelation or what it means and whether or not the LORD has spoken - Genesis 28:16. What you see and how well you see in the spirit however is determined by what spirit you are connected to and the faith that you carry towards it. The eyes of many have become blind in spirit because they have given up on their faith in God and they are constantly in need of being led - Isaiah 43:19. The eyes of the spirit are given to all men but they must be trained by continually seeking Him in faithful obedience if we seek Him we must also be ready to receive Him and obey Him - Mark 8:23-25.",
